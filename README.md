## Digital Forensics
This section is still in progress 

## Operating systems 
* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) is the most common operating system used for ethical hacking. 
  Best for all levels has the most tutorials and support and the largest community. Note various cybersecurity courses assume you are utilizing Kali including offensive security and pnpt/tcm
* [Parrot Security OS](http://www.parrotsec.org/) Similar to kali . easy to use but not as much support as Kali 
* [BlackArch Linux](http://www.blackarch.org/) very customizable version of Linux, with a very steep learning curve but is still very powerful
* For more info on individual Operating Systems see [distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/)
### ISOS
An ISO is a virtual "box" that contains all the necessary files and data to set up a computer system or an operating system. ISO files are typically used to distribute software, including operating systems like Windows or Linux. 
#### Windows ISO images from Microsoft
* [Windows 10 iso image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
* [Windows 8 iso image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8ISO)
* [Windows 7 iso image](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7)
#### Linux ISO images
Common Linux Distros 
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/) Stable and open-source OS with vast software repositories
* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)User-friendly Linux OS based on Debian with frequent updates
* [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) Accessible OS, great for beginners, based on Ubuntu
* [Arch](https://archlinux.org/download/) Lightweight and customizable Linux OS, preferred by experienced users
* [For more info on other Operating Systems](https://distrowatch.com/)
### Virtual machine software and virtualization
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) windows mac and Linux
* [Vmware](https://www.vmware.com/) Vmware workstation windows mac and Linux
* [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) emulator for running windows applications on Linux, macOS, & BSD (not a virtual machine) 
  Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on the fly,
  eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.
